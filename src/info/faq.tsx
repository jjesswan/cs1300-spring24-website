  {
    q: "Is this course capped?",
    a: "For Spring 2024 we expect to cap the course at about 100 students for now, but are looking to see if increasing this cap is compatible with our current plans. If you have not been contacted by us, then please wait for the shopping period to sign up for the waitlist after the first day of class, which is also when we will announce if we can increase the cap.",
  },
  {
    q: "IS THERE A WAITLIST FOR THE COURSE?",
    a: "We will set up a waitlist after the first day of class, which we will announce in class, and over email to students with the course in their cart, as well as post on the course website. At that time we'll know whether we can increase the cap a bit, so will be in a better position to organize the waitlist. The information about the waitlist will be sent over email to students with this course in their cart, announced in the first day of class, and posted on the website. Decisions about the waitlist will be made within 24 hours of the waitlist deadline.",
  },
  {
    q: "ARE THERE PREREQUISITES FOR THE COURSE?",
    a: "This course requires one of the intro CS sequences (CS15/16, CS17/18, or CS19) as well as CS32 (Intro to Software Engineering). You may request an override for the prerequisites by sending a link to a github repository of work you did demonstrating use of object-oriented programming, data structures, and functional programming concepts. If you are on the waitlist, then include the link there in the question field that asks for it. Graduate students that have taken courses that cover these topics should note that on the waitlist form.",
  },
  {
    q: "WILL THIS COURSE BE ONLINE OR IN-PERSON?",
    a: "In-person. Lectures will be live and also available as videos, and studios will be in person. Our current plan is to have lecture videos accessible to any student from Brown (and linked from the course schedule above) so those not enrolled in the course can view them. We are planning to have studios at different times (listed as lab hours), so please select a lab hour suitable for your schedule.",
  },
  {
    q: "WHAT WILL STUDIOS BE LIKE?",
    a: "Students sign up for studios by selecting the corresponding lab hour when registering. The studio lab hours will be outside regular lecture hours. TAs will have an activity prepared for students in studio, and will be around to give feedback to students during this time. Students are welcome to work collaboratively on the studio activities. Work done in studios may be good starters for your portfolio.",
  },
  {
    q: "CAN I TAKE THIS COURSE AS A NON-CS CONCENTRATOR OR INCOMING FIRST-YEAR STUDENT?",
    a: "Usually we have CS 0130 which is designed for non-concentrators and has no prerequistes. However, this year we are only offering CS 1300, but you may still enroll in CS 1300 if you satisfy those even as a non-CS concentrator.",
  },
  {
    q: "CAN I TAKE THIS COURSE AS A RISD STUDENT?",
    a: "This year we are not offering CS 0130 so RISD students should meet the same prerequisites as Brown students to take CS 1300.",
  },
  {
    q: "I WILL MISS CLASS ON [DATE]. CAN I BE EXCUSED?",
    a: "We do not take class attendance, but there may be in-class activities that require hand-in at the end of lecture. Each student can miss up to five (5) of these activity points with no consequence. If you anticipate missing more than five classes, contact the course instructors.",
  },
  {
    q: "CAN I TAKE THE COURSE AS A CAPSTONE?",
    a: "Yes, for a capstone, you should extend an assignment into something that has substantial development and design components and release it. For instance, you could take your Iterative Design prototype and build it fully to the point where it's a deployable app. This can be done as a group, but the amount of work should be proportional to the group size. Both juniors and seniors may take CS 1300 for a capstone. Only the online capstone form needs to be filled out, which you should already have received via email from the department earlier in September. The capstone can be done anytime in the semester, up until final grading is due.",
  },
  {
    q: "WILL THERE BE A TEXTBOOK FOR THE COURSE?",
    a: "No, all readings will be available on this website.",
  },
  {
    q: "WILL THERE BE A FINAL EXAM?",
    a: "No, you will complete a portfolio for your final assignment.",
  },
